Sprint 1:
As a librarian,
I want to add books with a unique Book ID, title, and author,
So that the library can maintain book records.
Sprint 2:
As a user,
I want to borrow and return books,
So that book availability is managed.
Sprint 3:
As a librarian,
I want to generate a library report,
So that I can view the status of all books.
